# AnotherSmallGame

## Overview
This is an **Augmented Reality (AR) game** built in Unity that allows players to **visualize planes**, **place objects**, and interact with them using **drag, rotate, and scale gestures**. The game uses AR Foundation to track the environment and enable immersive object placement.
